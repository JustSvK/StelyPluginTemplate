# StelyPluginTemplate
Template, for creating Stely plugins!

Hello, this is the plugins tab!

Here you can basically create your own plugin, which will work for Stely!

So, you can code here basically everything, just do not change the class name(StelyPlugin) or the void name(Main)

Btw, everything which is in Main will get only executed, so when you create new method, make sure to call it in there!
